# wine-quality-prediction

An analysis was conducted on the Wine Data to discern the factors that play a pivotal role in determining the quality of wine. An exploration of the correlations between these attributes and the overall wine quality was undertaken, while considering the interplay with other relevant factors

The initial phase involved an extensive examination of the variables in isolation,allowing for a comprehensive grasp of their unique features. Following this, rigorous
statistical analysis was employed to uncover the relationships and dependencies between these variables and the subjective wine quality ratings provided.

One of the key outcomes of this study was the development of a linear model designed to predict the quality of wine. This predictive model was constructed using the insights garnered from the data analysis and was intended to provide a valuable tool for estimating the quality of wine based on specific attributes.

By conducting this research, valuable insights were gained into the variables that significantly influence wine quality. Additionally, the development of a predictive model can enhance decision-making processes in the wine industry, providing a data-driven approach to quality assessment.
